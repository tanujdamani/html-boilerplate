# HTML Boilerplate

This is a basic static HTML page.

## Purpose

This project was created in order to put placeholder files when a new project or domain is launched. This is simply to create a standin, while the real project is under developement.

The boilerplate can be used as a Coming Soon page or just a hello page.

It is built using current standard so as not to negatively impact SEO, while also allow the indexing of the website.

This is the bare minimum.

# Files

Some information about all the supporting files.

## CSS

The CSS can be added in the style.css file

## JavaScript

The JavaScript can be added in the script.css file

## Images

The Images are stored in the img folder.

## Manifest

The manifest is a completely optional file and does not need to be included in such an implementation. The manifest can be updated in the manifest.json.

# Folder Structure

This is just a started for any HTML project. So the folder structure is very flat.

If you have multiple .css and .js files then you can adopt the below folder structure.

```
root
│   index.html
└───css
│   │   style.css
│   │   style2.css
│
└───js
    │   script.js
    │   script2.js
```

In order to not make the folder files visible by accident, I always prefer to upt a blank index.html page or redirect the user back to the homepage. This is up to you.
